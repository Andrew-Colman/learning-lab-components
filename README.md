# learning-lab-components

Open sourced components from [GitHub Learning Lab](https://lab.github.com/)

This library contains all of the JavaScript-based bot actions that Learning Lab course authors may utilize when writing their course steps. Check out [the docs on actions](https://lab.github.com/docs/using-actions) for more information about how they're used.

The bot actions from the [latest release of this repository on the GitHub Package Registry](https://github.com/github/learning-lab-components/packages) are used in production by GitHub Learning Lab.

By making these bot actions available as an open source library, we hope to encourage Learning Lab course authors to become invested in [contributing](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md):
 - reporting bugs and collaborating on fixes for existing bot actions
 - suggesting enhancements for existing bot actions
 - requesting or [creating new bot actions](actions/README.md#adding-a-new-action)
